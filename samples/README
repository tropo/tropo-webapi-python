These sample applications demonstrate the usage of this "tropo_web_api" python module with 
the Tropo cloud communications service at http://www.tropo.com

To use these examples you need to have:

1. an account at http://www.tropo.com/ (free for developers)
2. a web server where your app runs that is publicly accessible over the Internet

For #2, you could use either:
- a hosted service such as Google App Engine
- your own server running a separate web server such as "itty" 
     ( http://github.com/toastdriven/itty )
- a server running an existing web server that can execute python programs

Sample applications will eventually be provided for all these types.
