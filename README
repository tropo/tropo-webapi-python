NAME

    tropo - The TropoPython module. This module implements a set of classes and methods for manipulating the 
    Web API for the Tropo cloud communications service at http://www.tropo.com/

    For more information about the Tropo Web API that is used with this module, please see:

        http://www.tropo.com/docs/webapi/

    As this python module is still in development, please report any bugs or issues by raising an issue here:

DESCRIPTION

    Usage:
    
    ----
    from tropo import Tropo

    tropo = Tropo()
    tropo.say("Hello, World")
    json = tropo.RenderJson() 
    ----
    
    You can write this JSON back to standard output to get Tropo to perform 
    the action. For example, on Google Appengine you might write something like:
    
    handler.response.out.write(json)
    
    Much of the time, a you will interact with Tropo by  examining the Result 
    object and communicating back to Tropo via the Tropo class methods, such 
    as "say". In some cases, you'll want to build a class object directly such as in :
    
        choices = tropo.Choices("[5 digits]").obj
    
        tropo.ask(choices, 
                  say="Please enter your 5 digit zip code.", 
                  attempts=3, bargein=True, name="zip", timeout=5, voice="dave")
        ...

NOTE ON PYTHON VERSIONS

    This module is for python 2.x and requires python 2.5 or higher.  
    There is a separate version available for python 3.x at:

     |      operator.
     |  
     |  failUnless(self, expr, msg=None)
     |      Fail the test unless the expression is true.
     |  
     |  failUnlessAlmostEqual(self, first, second, places=7, msg=None)
     |      Fail if the two objects are unequal as determined by their
     |      difference rounded to the given number of decimal places
     |      (default 7) and comparing to zero.
     |      
     |      Note that decimal places (from zero) are usually not the same
     |      as significant digits (measured from the most signficant digit).
     |  
     |  failUnlessEqual(self, first, second, msg=None)
     |      Fail if the two objects are unequal as determined by the '=='
     |      operator.
     |  
     |  failUnlessRaises(self, excClass, callableObj, *args, **kwargs)
     |      Fail unless an exception of class excClass is thrown
     |      by callableObj when invoked with arguments args and keyword
     |      arguments kwargs. If a different type of exception is
     |      thrown, it will not be caught, and the test case will be
     |      deemed to have suffered an error, exactly as for an
     |      unexpected exception.
     |  
     |  id(self)
     |  
     |  run(self, result=None)
     |  
     |  setUp(self)
     |      Hook method for setting up the test fixture before exercising it.
     |  
     |  shortDescription(self)
     |      Returns a one-line description of the test, or None if no
     |      description has been provided.
     |      
     |      The default implementation of this method returns the first line of
     |      the specified test method's docstring.
     |  
     |  tearDown(self)
     |      Hook method for deconstructing the test fixture after testing it.
